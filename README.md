## huggingface-go

A minimal, unofficial PoC client library for interacting with the Hugging Face Hub with Go.

Currently, the focus will be on downloading/uploading files from model repositories.

Roadmap

- [x] Repository creation
- [x] Upload file to the Hub
- [x] Upload LFS file to the Hub
- [ ] (v0) Download file from the Hub
- [ ] Multipart uploads
- [ ] Pull Requests
- [ ] Multifile upload
- [ ] Advanced repository management

The library intends to be minimal. For feature-complete options, check the official `huggingface_hub` Python or TypeScript libraries or the CLI.
